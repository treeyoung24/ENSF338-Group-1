1. timeit and repeat are two approaches that attempts to address the issues caused when  incorrect time measurements occur. It is more appropriate to use timeit over repeat when the code is only needed to be run once, or very minimal times. Timeit is used when only one measurement is needed. Repeat is used when multiple repeated measurements are needed, it is more useful when a list of times, including minimum, average and maximum times are needed. 

2. The appropriate statistic to apply to the output of timeit.timeit() would be the average statistic. Since the timeit is only run once, then the average is represented by the time it takes to execute once. Meanwhile, all three average, min and max are appropriate statistics to apply to the output of timeit.repeat() because repeat function returns a list of times for multiple executions. From this list, the minimum time representes the fastest run or the best case scenario, the maximum time represents the slowest run and the worst case scenario, the average time gives you the average amount of time it takes to run the code.
