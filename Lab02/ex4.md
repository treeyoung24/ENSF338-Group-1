Exercise 4/3

1. The algorithm that would be used to find this room would be a linear search, as you are walking through every room and checking if it's the target value.

2. There would be 15 "steps" to find room EY128, a step in this scenario would the each room being checked on the way towards EY128.

3. This is neither, as a best case scanario would be the first step while last case scenario would be the last step. This is ?????

4. A worst-case scanario would have the target room to be found to be EY130, while a best case scenario would be target to find room EY100.

5. In order to improve the algorithm to make it more efficient. You can change the sign into something that resembles a binary search instead, where half the rooms left of room EY118 would be a sign pointing to the left saying rooms EY100-EY118 and the remaining half of the rooms to the right of the room EY118 would be a sign pointing to the right sasying rooms EY118-EY138.
